Verbatim: Netflix dual subtitle extension using Python as a language processor.

Technologies used:
+ Python
+ HTML 5
+ Javascript

I wanted to see how effective a dual subtitle language learning model was in practise but I also wanted the flexibility to tune the learning criteria / functionalities to how I learn best. 

The project will mainly leverage free open-source technologies and the goal is to be able to clone the codebase and host it on any users server.
